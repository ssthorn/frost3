          We are aggressive in legal matters, but we show a different side when
          it comes to our firm&apos;s culture and our commitment to legal education.
          We care deeply about providing on-the-job mentorship and creating
          opportunities for gifted aspiring lawyers from underrepresented
          backgrounds. Frost LLP is proud to support community initiatives that
          are true to our vision of the legal profession&apos;s future. Frost LLP
          founding partner Christopher Frost serves as an adjunct professor at
          his alma mater, the Caruso School of Law (CSOL) at Pepperdine
          University. Inspired by the impact of the Suit Stipend Project, which
          provides financial support for first-generation law students needing
          to purchase suits for their first professional interviews, Frost LLP
          is endowing the Frost LLP and Frost Hassid Advisors Dress for Success
          Suit Stipend Program.
